      "description": "C++ is a compiled, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and first released in 1985, C++ builds on C with object-oriented features, allowing for both low-level memory manipulation and high-level abstractions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications."
