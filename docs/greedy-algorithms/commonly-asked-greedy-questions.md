## 1. Huffman Coding

### Definition:
Huffman Coding is a method used for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

### Characteristics:
- **Building a Min-Heap**: Create a min-heap to store characters and their frequencies.
- **Tree Structure**: Combine the two least frequent nodes iteratively to build a binary tree.
- **Prefix Codes**: The binary representation of characters is derived from the tree, ensuring that no code is a prefix of another.

### Applications:
- Data compression (e.g., ZIP files)
- Encoding for transmission

## 2. Prim’s Algorithm

### Definition:
Prim’s Algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph.

### Characteristics:
- **Start with a Single Vertex**: Initialize the tree with one vertex.
- **Add the Cheapest Edge**: At each step, add the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the tree to one outside it.
- **Repeat**: Continue until all vertices are included in the MST.

### Applications:
- Network design
- Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems

## 3. Kruskal’s Algorithm

### Definition:
Kruskal’s Algorithm is another method to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.

### Characteristics:
- **Sort Edges**: Begin by sorting all edges in ascending order of their weight.
- **Add Edges**: Add edges to the MST one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed using union-find data structures.
- **Complete MST**: Repeat until you have `V-1` edges (where `V` is the number of vertices).

### Applications:
- Network routing
- Cluster analysis

## 4. Fractional Knapsack Problem

### Definition:
The Fractional Knapsack Problem allows taking fractions of an item to maximize the total value in a knapsack.

### Characteristics:
- **Value-to-Weight Ratio**: Calculate the ratio for each item.
- **Sorting**: Sort items by their value-to-weight ratio.
- **Greedy Selection**: Add as much of the highest ratio item as possible until the knapsack is full.

### Applications:
- Resource allocation
- Budget management

## 5. Coin Change Problem

### Definition:
The Coin Change Problem aims to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount using given denominations.

### Characteristics:
- **Greedy Approach**: Use the largest denomination first.
- **Reduction**: Continue until the remaining amount is zero.
- **Optimality**: Works optimally for standard denominations (like US coins).

### Applications:
- Currency exchange
- Financial transactions

## 6. Minimum Number of Platforms

### Definition:
The Minimum Number of Platforms problem determines how many platforms are required at a railway station to accommodate all trains at their arrival and departure times.

### Characteristics:
- **Sorting Events**: Sort arrival and departure times.
- **Tracking Platforms**: Use a greedy approach to track the number of trains at any given time and update the platform requirement.

### Applications:
- Scheduling at transportation hubs
- Event management

## 7. Staircase Problem

### Definition:
The Staircase Problem involves finding the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with `N` steps when you can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

### Characteristics:
- **Recurrence Relation**: The number of ways to reach the nth step can be defined as `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Although greedy, can also be solved using dynamic programming for optimization.

### Applications:
- Combinatorial problems
- Dynamic programming practice

## 8. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

### Definition:
This problem involves determining the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling a stock once, given an array of stock prices.

### Characteristics:
- **Tracking Minimum Price**: Keep track of the minimum price encountered so far.
- **Calculating Profit**: For each price, calculate the potential profit and update the maximum profit if it exceeds the current maximum.

### Applications:
- Stock market analysis
- Financial modeling

## 9. Minimize Maximum Distance to Assign Tasks

### Definition:
Given a set of workers and tasks, this problem aims to assign tasks in a way that minimizes the maximum distance any worker has to travel.

### Characteristics:
- **Sorting**: Sort workers and tasks based on their distances.
- **Greedy Assignment**: Assign tasks to the nearest available worker to minimize the maximum distance.

### Applications:
- Task scheduling
- Logistics optimization

---

## 10. Rearranging Coins Problem

### Definition:
This problem involves determining if you can rearrange a set of coins to satisfy specific conditions or form valid sequences.

### Characteristics:
- **Greedy Grouping**: Use a greedy approach to group or arrange coins based on given criteria.
- **Condition Checking**: Ensure conditions are met after each rearrangement or assignment.

### Applications:
- Resource management
- Game theory
