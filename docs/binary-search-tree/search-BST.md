In this post, we will discuss how to search for a specific value in a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. A BST is a special kind of binary tree where each node has a value greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.

## Problem Definition
Given a binary search tree and a target value, the goal is to determine if the target value exists in the tree. If it exists, we return the corresponding node; otherwise, we return `NULL`.

## Approach
To search for a value in a BST, we can utilize the properties of the BST. Starting from the root node, we compare the target value with the value of the current node:

1. If the target value is equal to the current node's value, we have found the target, and we return the current node.
2. If the target value is less than the current node's value, we search in the left subtree.
3. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, we search in the right subtree.

### Steps:
1. Start from the root node.
2. If the current node is `NULL`, return `NULL`.
3. Compare the target value with the current node's value:
   - If they are equal, return the current node.
   - If the target value is less, move to the left child.
   - If the target value is greater, move to the right child.
4. Repeat until you find the target or exhaust the tree.

### C++ Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary search tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to search a value in a binary search tree
TreeNode* searchBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == NULL || root->val == val) {
        return root;
    }
    if (val < root->val) {
        return searchBST(root->left, val);
    } else {
        return searchBST(root->right, val);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);

    int target = 2;
    TreeNode* result = searchBST(root, target);

    if (result != NULL) {
        cout << "Found: " << result->val << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Value not found in the BST." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
