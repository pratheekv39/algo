## Tarjan's Algorithm:
Tarjan's Algorithm is a graph traversal technique used to find all strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph. It employs depth-first search (DFS) and uses a low-link value to keep track of the smallest reachable vertex.

## Introduction

In graph theory, a strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. Tarjan's Algorithm efficiently identifies all SCCs using a single DFS traversal, making it suitable for various applications in network analysis, compiler design, and more.

## Characteristics of Tarjan's Algorithm

1. **Single DFS Traversal**: The algorithm performs a single depth-first search traversal of the graph.
2. **Low-Link Values**: It uses low-link values to determine the smallest reachable vertex in the DFS tree.
3. **Stack-Based**: The algorithm utilizes a stack to track vertices and identify components.

## How Tarjan's Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Maintain an index to assign unique identifiers to vertices during DFS traversal.
   - Use a low-link array to track the lowest index reachable from each vertex.
   - Use a stack to keep track of vertices in the current DFS path.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each unvisited vertex, assign it an index and initialize its low-link value.
   - Perform DFS on its neighbors:
     - If a neighbor is unvisited, recursively apply Tarjanâ€™s algorithm.
     - Update the low-link value based on the neighbor's low-link value.
     - If the neighbor is in the stack, update the low-link value to reflect its index.
  
3. **Component Identification**:
   - After visiting all neighbors, check if the vertex is a root of an SCC:
     - If it is, pop vertices from the stack until the vertex itself is reached, marking them as part of the same component.

4. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been visited, and all SCCs have been identified.

## Step-by-Step Execution

Consider a simple directed graph:

  B --> C
  C --> A
  B --> D
  D --> E
  E --> D
```


### Code Implementation:

```java
    import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Stack;

public class TarjanAlgorithm {
    private int index = 0;
    private int[] indices;
    private int[] lowLink;
    private boolean[] onStack;
    private Stack<Integer> stack;
    private List<List<Integer>> sccs;

    public List<List<Integer>> tarjansAlgorithm(List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        indices = new int[n];
        lowLink = new int[n];
        onStack = new boolean[n];
        stack = new Stack<>();
        sccs = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
            if (indices[v] == 0) {
                strongconnect(v, graph);
            }
        }

        return sccs;
    }

    private void strongconnect(int v, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        indices[v] = lowLink[v] = ++index;
        stack.push(v);
        onStack[v] = true;

        for (int w : graph.get(v)) {
            if (indices[w] == 0) {
                // Successor w has not yet been visited; recurse on it
                strongconnect(w, graph);
                lowLink[v] = Math.min(lowLink[v], lowLink[w]);
            } else if (onStack[w]) {
                // Successor w is in stack and hence in the current SCC
                lowLink[v] = Math.min(lowLink[v], indices[w]);
            }
        }

        // If v is a root node, pop the stack and generate an SCC
        if (lowLink[v] == indices[v]) {
            List<Integer> scc = new ArrayList<>();
            int w;
            do {
                w = stack.pop();
                onStack[w] = false;
                scc.add(w);
            } while (w != v);
            sccs.add(scc);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a sample directed graph
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        // Add edges (directed)
        graph.get(0).add(1);
        graph.get(1).add(2);
        graph.get(2).add(0);
        graph.get(1).add(3);
        graph.get(3).add(4);
        graph.get(4).add(3);

        TarjanAlgorithm tarjan = new TarjanAlgorithm();
        List<List<Integer>> sccs = tarjan.tarjansAlgorithm(graph);

        System.out.println("Strongly Connected Components:");
        for (List<Integer> scc : sccs) {
            System.out.println(scc);
        }
    }
}

```
