### Definition:

Tree Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) from the elements of the array and then performs an in-order traversal to retrieve the elements in sorted order. It is efficient when the tree remains balanced, but can degrade to quadratic time complexity in the worst case.

### Characteristics:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Tree Sort inserts elements into a binary search tree where each node follows the property: the left child is smaller than the parent node and the right child is larger.

- **In-Order Traversal**:
  - Once all elements are inserted into the BST, an in-order traversal is performed to retrieve the elements in sorted order.

- **Not In-Place**:
  - Tree Sort is not an in-place algorithm because it uses additional memory to store the BST.

- **Stable**:
  - Tree Sort can be stable if implemented carefully by ensuring that equal elements are inserted in a way that maintains their relative order.

### Time Complexity:

- **Best Case: O(n log n)**  
  When the tree remains balanced, insertion and traversal operations are logarithmic, resulting in an overall complexity of O(n log n).

- **Average Case: O(n log n)**  
  For random input, the tree usually remains balanced.

- **Worst Case: O(n¬≤)**  
  In the worst case, such as when inserting elements that are already sorted, the tree can become skewed, and the algorithm may take O(n¬≤) time.

### Space Complexity:

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**  
  The algorithm uses extra space for the tree structure, proportional to the number of elements in the input array.

### Java Implementation:

```java
// Class to represent a node in the BST
class TreeNode {
    int value;
    TreeNode left, right;

    public TreeNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

// TreeSort class
public class TreeSort {
    TreeNode root;

    // Method to insert a node into the BST
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRec(root, value);
    }

    // Recursive method to insert a node into the BST
    TreeNode insertRec(TreeNode root, int value) {
        if (root == null) {
            root = new TreeNode(value);
            return root;
        }
        if (value < root.value) {
            root.left = insertRec(root.left, value);
        } else if (value > root.value) {
            root.right = insertRec(root.right, value);
        }
        return root;
    }

    // Method to perform an in-order traversal
    void inorderRec(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            inorderRec(root.left);
            System.out.print(root.value + " ");
            inorderRec(root.right);
        }
    }

    // Main function to sort an array using Tree Sort
    void treeSort(int[] arr) {
        for (int value : arr) {
            insert(value);
        }
        inorderRec(root);  // Prints the sorted elements
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSort tree = new TreeSort();
        int[] arr = {5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 1, 9};
        System.out.println("Sorted array:");
        tree.treeSort(arr);
    }
}
```

### Summary:
Tree Sort is an intuitive and simple sorting algorithm that leverages the properties of Binary Search Trees to sort an array. While its average-case time complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõlogùëõ) O(nlogn), it can degrade to ùëÇ(ùëõ2) O(n2) in the worst case, making it less suitable for practical use in many scenarios compared to other algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort.
